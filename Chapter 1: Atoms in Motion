1-1 Introduction
"The principle of science, the definition, almost, is the following: The test of all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of scientific 'truth'."

"Experiment, itself, helps to produce these laws, in the sense that it gives us hints. But also needed is imagination to create from these hints the great generalizations—to guess at the wonderful, simple, but very strange patterns beneath them all, and then to experiment to check again whether we have made the right guess."

1-2 Matter is Made of Atoms

Feynman calls the following Atomic Hypothesis the statement that contains the most amount of information in the fewest number of words.
Atomic Hypothesis - all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.

This next segment helps illustrate how more information can be derived from the atomic hypothesis:

When magnified, a drop of water will reveal countless molecules, each made of 1 oxygen and 2 hydrogen atoms. These molecules are constantly jiggling around, and we call the magnitude of this motion "heat". 

The water keeps its volume due to the mutual attraction between the atoms and the molecules, even when flowing down a hill. If we increase the temperature of the water, its heat increases, and the molecules may fly apart and turn the water to steam. The volume of the steam is naturally larger, and the increased motion of the molecules was high enough to overcome the innate attraction. 

If we imagine these molecules as a bunch of very fast moving tennis balls in a large warehouse. At the speed these tennis balls are moving, they would at least dent and push at the walls of the warehouse. In real life, we only feel the average of these forces, and in most cases, it is imperceptible to us. 

To confine a gas, like steam, we need to apply pressure, so imagine we store the steam in a cylinder with a piston inside it. Since so many water particles are bombarding the top of the container, the piston needs to apply some force to stay in place and not get blown off the container. This force is called the pressure, and to be a little more technically, the force is actually the pressure times the area. This force is naturally proportionally to the area, since if we increase the area of the piston's surface while keeping the number of molecules per cubic centimeter constant, the number of collisions with the piston would increase. 

Doubling the number of molecules in the cylinder approximately doubles the number of collisions, so at a fairly low density, denisty and pressure are proportional. In real life, there's a slight decrease in pressure due to the attraction between atoms, and a slight increase in pressure since there's a finite volume. 

If we increase the temperature in this cylinder, the pressure would naturally increase, since the atoms are hitting the piston harder. 

If we were to press the piston forward (i.e. reducing the volume of the gas), something interesting happens. Just as a ping pong ball increases speed as it is hit by a forward moving paddle, the molecules of the water will increase in speed (i.e. temperature) as the piston moves forward. Thus, under a slow compression of a gas, the temperature of the gas increases, and under a slow expansion of a gas, the temperature of the gas decreases. 

Going back to the drop of water, if we were to decrease it's temperature, the motion would slow, and the attraction between the molecules wouldn't really have anything to oppose it. In water, the molecules lock into a pattern called ice. In this crystalline array, the position of atoms on one side of the crystal is determined by that of other atoms millions of atoms away on the other side of the crystal. Ice has a hexagonal structure, which leaves more space between the atoms. Thus, when water freezes, it expands.
Most simple substances, with the exception of water and some metals, expand upon water, because the atoms are closely packed in a solid crystal and upon melting, the material needs more room to jiggle around. In the case of water, the open structure collapses. It is important to note that the atoms are still vibrating in the structure even when frozen, and melting is the act of atoms jiggling out of the structure. 

At absolute zero, the vibration decreases. There is a minimum amount of vibration that atoms can have, but this vibration is not zero. This minimum vibration is low enough that it won't melt substances, with the exception of Helium. We can solidify Helium by keeping it at absolute zero AND increasing the pressure to make it so great that the atoms squash together.
